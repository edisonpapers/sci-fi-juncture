# Introduction

In this exhibit we explore the ways in which Edison, during his lifetime, speculated about the technological future and inspired others to imagine how science and technology would change society.  The centerpiece of this exhibit is the collaboration between Edison and journalist George Parsons Lathrop on a novel of the future in the style of Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward.  It also examines serious and satirical fiction  in which Edison appears as a protaganist and dime novels known as Edisonades.  It concludes by looking at Edison’s own speculations about the future that appeared in newspaper and journal interviews.

## The Wizard of Menlo Park
Almost as soon as Thomas Edison became famous for his invention of the phonograph in early 1878 journalists and writers began to depict him as the [“Inventor of the Age,”](http://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/MBSB10561) capable of producing any invention he set his mind to and as the embodiment of the forces of science and technology that were transforming the modern world. Some of the earliest accounts played humorously with his growing legend. The first was New York Daily Graphic reporter William Croffut’s fantastical [April Fool’s](http://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/MBSB10470X) story of Edison’s machine for manufacturing food out of “air, water and common earth.”  It was Crouffut who dubbed Edison the ["Wizard of Menlo Park."](http://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/MBSB10500X)
