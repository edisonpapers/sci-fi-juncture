# Introduction

In this exhibit we explore the ways in which Edison, during his lifetime, speculated about the technological future and inspired others to imagine how science and technology would change society.  The centerpiece of this exhibit is the collaboration between Edison and journalist George Parsons Lathrop on a novel of the future in the style of Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward.  It also examines serious and satirical fiction  in which Edison appears as a protaganist and dime novels known as Edisonades.  It concludes by looking at Edison’s own speculations about the future that appeared in newspaper and journal interviews.

## The Wizard of Menlo Park

Almost as soon as Thomas Edison became famous for his invention of the phonograph in early 1878 journalists and writers began to depict him as the [“Inventor of the Age,”](http://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/MBSB10561) capable of producing any invention he set his mind to and as the embodiment of the forces of science and technology that were transforming the modern world. Some of the earliest accounts played humorously with his growing legend. The first was New York Daily Graphic reporter William Croffut’s fantastical [April Fool’s](http://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/MBSB10470X) story of Edison’s machine for manufacturing food out of “air, water and common earth.”  It was Crouffut who dubbed Edison the ["Wizard of Menlo Park."](http://edisondigital.rutgers.edu/document/MBSB10500X)<br><br>Later in the year the satirical magazine Punch’s Almanack published a series of humorous drawings depicting Edison’s [“telephonoscope,”](https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/punch_almanack1879/0006/image) for transmitting pictures and sound like an early television, and his [“anti-gravitation underclothing.”](https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/punch_almanack1879/0002/image)

A more serious literary effort was a short story written by French author Villiers de l’Isle-Adam in 1878.  Inspired by the emergence of the Edison legend he conceived a story he called “L’Andréïde paradoxale d’Edison,” which he subsequently expanded into a novel entitled L’Eve future, published in 1886. In the preface to his book de l’Isle-Adam explained how the emerging Edison myth inspired his story (and would inspire others): “Henceforth, doesn’t the personage of this legend—even while the man is still alive who inspired it—belong to the world of literature?”<br><br>This would not be the last time that Edison inspired a literary work that embodied elements of what would become known as science fiction.  Indeed, Edison himself collaborated with journalist and writer George Parsons Lathrop on a novel of the future to be entitled “Progress.” <br><br>Always willing to accommodate journalists requesting interviews, Edison also become a ready source of expertise on issues of science and technology. As the twentieth century approached there was a growing interest in speculations about the future and Edison was asked him to meditate on its technological possibilities. In 1890, for example, the editor of the North American Review requested that he contribute “a few hundred words” on the future of electricity. A year earlier, the editor of The Forum, after publishing a humorous account of the year 2889 by Jules Verne, thought it appropriate to call on the world’s preeminent inventor to write a more “serious article, undertaking to show what invention may possibly produce in 1000 years.” While Edison declined these invitations to write articles, he was more than willing to speculate about the future when interviewed by journalists.

## Tomorrow's Eve

In 1878 the French writer named Villiers de l’Isle-Adam  was inspired by enormous press attention that was given to Thomas Edison and his newly invented phonograph to write a story he called “L’Andréïde paradoxale d’Edison.”  He subsequently expanded this into a novel entitled  [L’Eve future](https://archive.org/details/lvefuture00villuoft/page/n7/mode/2up), which was first published in 1886.  In the novel, Edison creates an android—the Eve of the title—that is not only indistinguishable from its human model but even considered a marked improvement upon it.

Although the means by which the fictional Edison employs his phonograph, microphone, electric motors, and even the techniques of mesmerism to create the android has little basis in technological fact, Villiers’s invocation of the famous inventor and his inventions provides a sense of verisimilitude for the fantastic tale that he tells.  In writing his novel, Villiers clearly drew on contemporary newspaper and magazine accounts of the famous inventor to create his fictional Edison, who was already becoming a legendary figure seen as capable of producing any invention and embodying the forces of science and technology that were transforming the modern world.

Villiers describes the transformation of Edison from man to myth In the preface to his book:
> In America and in Europe a legend has sprung up in the popular mind regarding this great citizen of the United States.  He has become the recipient of thousands of nicknames, such as “The Magician of the Century,” “The Sorcerer of Menlo Park,” the “Papa of the Phonograph,” and so forth and so on.  A perfectly natural enthusiasm in his own country and elsewhere has conferred on him a kind of mystique, or something like it, in many minds. Henceforth, doesn’t the personage of this legend—even while the man is still alive who inspired it—belong to the world of literature?  For example, if Doctor Johann Faust had been living in the age of Goethe and had given rise to his symbolic legend at that time, wouldn’t the writing of Faust, even then, have been a perfectly legitimate undertaking? Thus, the Edison of the present work, his character, his dwelling, his language, and his theories, are and ought to be at least somewhat distinct from anything existing in reality. Let it be understood, then, that I interpret a modern legend to the best advantage of Art-metaphysics that I have conceived; and that, in a word, the hero of this book is above all “The Sorcerer of Menlo Park,” and so forth—and not the engineer, Mr. Edison, our contemporary. <br>quoted from Robert Martin Adams’s translation, Tomorrow’s Eve, University of Illinois Press, 1982
